## Contributing

### Branches
There are branches set up for the core aspects of the aircraft. 
To contribute to the project, you should follow the workflow we have set up to keep things organized:


## Opening the aircraft in the simulator

With these source files, you can open the aircraft in the simulator to work on the flight model, instruments, displays, or anything else that requires the aircraft itself. To do this, make sure you have the most recent version of the github files, and enable developer mode in the Flight Simulator settings. After this, click on 'Tools' in the bar at the top of your screen, select aircraft editor, and click 'Load Project'. In this file menu, find your GitHub folder (usually in Documents), and navigate to B757_2.xml. Double click this file to load it into the project editor. 

You should then go to the 'Windows' option in the menu bar and select 'Aircraft Selector'. Scroll to the bottom and select the ParallelFS Boeing 757-200. Once you have this loaded, opent the 'Tools' menu again and select 'Aircraft Editor'. You can then edit parameters and see your changes in-game.
